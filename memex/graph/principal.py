"""Principal node bootstrap writes (Phase 02 / NET-08).

`write_principal_node()` is the answer to 02-RESEARCH.md Open Question #1:
how does the very first admin `Principal` node get created, given
`Principal.write_policy = "locked"` requires `role in ("admin", "system")`
to write it?

This module writes `:Entity{type:'Principal'}` nodes via direct Cypher
(`client.driver.execute_query(...)`), following the existing `:Entity` +
`type`-discriminator convention used by every other structured node type
(see `memex/graph/writer.py`) — never through `client.add_episode()`, which
would route structured identity metadata through Graphiti's LLM-driven
episode/entity extraction pipeline (wrong tool, unnecessary cost/latency).

`write_principal_node()` is called ONLY from the CLI's trusted `keys add`
handler (`memex/cli.py`) — never from `memex/mcp_server/tools_write.py`'s
agent-facing ACL-gated write path. It structurally bypasses
`check_write_policy()` exactly like the watcher's direct writes in
`writer.py` do, because the CLI operator IS the trusted local process
bootstrapping the system (see 02-RESEARCH.md Architecture Pattern 2 and
threat model T-02-05).
